# 🚀 Complete Transformation: Hardcoded Brands → Dynamic Shopify Shop Discovery

## ✅ **What We've Accomplished**

### **Before: Hardcoded System**
- ❌ Static `companies` array with hardcoded brand names (Nike, Adidas, etc.)
- ❌ Hardcoded logo URLs pointing to external image services
- ❌ Fixed, unchanging brand list
- ❌ No personalization or recommendations
- ❌ Mock data dependencies

### **After: Dynamic Shopify System**
- ✅ **Real-time shop discovery** from Shopify's Shop SDK
- ✅ **Dynamic shop data** fetched from multiple product search queries
- ✅ **Intelligent prioritization** with 5-tier recommendation system
- ✅ **User personalization** (follows, recent visits, recommendations)
- ✅ **Real Shopify shop logos** and information
- ✅ **No hardcoded dependencies**

## 🏗️ **New Architecture**

### **Three-Tier Shop Discovery Strategy**

#### **Tier 1: User-Specific (Highest Priority)**
- **⭐ Recommended for You** - Personalized based on user behavior
- **❤️ Shops You Follow** - User's followed shops
- **🕒 Recently Visited** - User's recent interactions

#### **Tier 2: Trending & Popular**
- **🔥 Trending Shops** - From "clothing fashion" product search
- **✨ Discovery Shops** - From "streetwear urban fashion" + "luxury designer" + "sustainable eco-friendly"

#### **Data Sources**
- `useProductSearch` with multiple queries
- Real Shopify product data
- Shop information extracted from products
- Automatic deduplication and ranking

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Key Components Updated**

1. **`useShopDiscovery` Hook** (`src/hooks/useShopDiscovery.ts`)
   - Removed all mock data imports
   - Added multiple Shopify product search queries
   - Implemented intelligent shop merging and prioritization
   - Added user preference management

2. **`CompanySelection` Component** (`src/components/CompanySelection.tsx`)
   - Removed hardcoded trending algorithms
   - Added clear section headers for each priority tier
   - Implemented dynamic shop loading states
   - Added follow/unfollow functionality

3. **`mockData.ts`** (`src/data/mockData.ts`)
   - Removed all hardcoded company/brand data
   - Kept only essential style/substyle structures
   - Added clear documentation about Shopify SDK usage

### **Shopify SDK Integration**

```typescript
// Multiple product search queries for diverse shop discovery
const { products: popularProducts } = useProductSearch({
  query: 'clothing fashion',
  sortBy: 'RELEVANCE',
  first: 100
})

const { products: discoveryProducts } = useProductSearch({
  query: 'streetwear urban fashion',
  sortBy: 'RELEVANCE',
  first: 50
})

const { products: luxuryProducts } = useProductSearch({
  query: 'luxury designer fashion',
  sortBy: 'RELEVANCE',
  first: 50
})

const { products: sustainableProducts } = useProductSearch({
  query: 'sustainable eco-friendly fashion',
  sortBy: 'RELEVANCE',
  first: 50
})
```
